    <P>Ever since I can remember, I have always wanted a monkey.
      At one time in my life, my stepfather had me believing that
      I was actually going to get one. Together we made plans of how
      we would set my room up to accommodate my monkey and he also
      went as far as taking me to various pet shops to look at
      monkeys for sale.  My favorite monkey is the capuchin monkey
      (spider monkey). I wanted one just like the one in
      “Monkey Trouble”, but I would have settled for any monkey.
      The spider monkey has a life span of 25-40 years, so it would
      not suit me to get one at my age. However I did some research
      and found a monkey better suited for me, and that is the
      Pygmy Marmoset (Finger Monkey), which has a life span of 15-20
      years
     </p>
    <p> I plan on getting one of these monkeys within the next few years
     so my website project will contain all of the information about
     this type of monkey, how much they cost, where they can be
     purchased or should be purchased and how to care for them properly.
